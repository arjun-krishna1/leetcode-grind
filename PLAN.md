- FROM https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/1390557/how-to-improve-my-coding-skills by coderana
- It looks like you simply skimmed through those questions without having a complete grasp of underlying concept.
"Quality" is any day better than "Quantity".

- I'll suggest the following points:

## DONE A : Building Blocks
#### DONE 1. Make sure you absolutely understand when to use "For", "while" and typical programming constructs.
- For example :
- Can you print all even numbers from N to 0 using both ?
```
def print(n):
  for i in range(n):
    print(n)

```
- Can you print elements of array from left and right at the same time : [ 0,1,2,4,5] -> [ 0, 5] -> [ 1,4 ] -> [ 2 ]
- When to use "break" statement and "continue" ?
#### DONE 2. If Step 1 is ensured try simpler problem like reverse printing numbers
- See that if you can reverse a number , can you then also apply the same concept to find the sum of digits
- Similarly there are other questions at this level like Armstrong, Palindrome , Prime numbers etc
- Just take a Pen and Paper and write down what's happening at individual step or maybe use some online code visualiser

## DONE B: Understand Basic Data Structures
#### DONE 1. Have an absolute mastery over how basic DS like "Stack", "Queue", "Array" , "String" , "Sets", "Dictionary / key-value Map / JSON " works
[ For now you may avoid LinkedList, Tree, Trie etc and just stick to the basics ]
#### TODO 2. Don't just read a theory or watch a video on them. Implement them.

## TODO C : Understand Basic Algorithms
#### TODO implement
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
3. Bubble Sort
4. Selection Sort
5. Insertion Sort


## TODO D : Repeat everything you have learnt so far

## DONE E : Solve "EASY" problems with acceptance between "90 - 70" then "70-50" and gradually solving easy problems randomly
#### DONE Don't peek through "Discuss Section" or look out for hint until you have given your best.

## TODO F : Now Move to data Structures like Linked List , Doubly Linked List and Tree
#### TODO Learn how to traverse through them , add , remove, update and other basic ops.

## G: TODO Understand how recursion works , try writing numbers from 1-100 using recursion

## TODO H : Learn More Advanced Data Structures & algorithms e.g { Merge Sort , QuickSort, Cycle Sort , Tree , Tries , Doubly Linked List etc }
#### TODO implement these

## TODO I : From here on slowly keep increasing your difficulty level on leetcode

Hope it helps
