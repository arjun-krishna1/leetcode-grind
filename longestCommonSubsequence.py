# Self-critique:
## Positive:
- I'm very happy that I came up with a working, efficient algorithm for this complex problem!!!! ðŸš€ ðŸŽ‰
- this is a classic dynamic programming problem
- we want longest common substring of two long strings (complex problem)
- so first we get the longest common substring of each part of each string (smaller, simpler subproblems)
- we add one char to the algorithm at a time and build it to the answer of the big complex problem
## Negative:
- I didn't solve it as fast as I could have
  - I should have first walked through the algorithm in detail
  - Specifically how we choose what to use as the longest common substring when there are multiple options
  - And how to add a character to the previous lcs when we have matching characters
- My solution wasn't optimal
# How to improve next time?
- Write down specific algorithm for problem before jumping into code
  - a finite sequence of well-defined instructions
  - Nothing should be left up to the imagination
- Practice more dynamic programming problems

Whooo! Super proud of myself for solving this

# Optimal Solution
- After watching the conceptual walkthrough of this problem
- I used that to crate a consistently faster than 85% solution
- The video thought about it recursively, with the elements above, to the left and on the diagonal
- represting solutions to the recursive subproblems
- And using that information instead of some other complex logic
